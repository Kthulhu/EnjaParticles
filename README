    ### EnjaParticles in C++ using OpenCL and OpenGL interoperability

rtpslib/
    RTPS: Real-Time Particle Systems
    A framework library for developing particle systems.
    We currently working on support for 
        Simple particle systems
        SPH Fluid simulation
        Boid simulation



    Build:
    see INSTALL file

    Dependencies:
    OpenCL
    OpenGL
    GLEW
    assimp 2.0
    Qt 4.8
    Boost 1.4

    Obtaining dependencies.
    assimp library:
        For Ubuntu 12.04:
            sudo apt-get install libassimp-dev
        Other linux distributions:
            see website for installation instructions - http://assimp.sourceforge.net/
    Qt 4.8:
        For Ubuntu 12.04:
            sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools
        Other linux distributions:
            see website for installation instructions - http://qt.nokia.com/downloads
    boost:
        Most linux distributions:
            sudo apt-get install libboost-dev

    Usage:

    You can execute the test program like:
        ./bin/test_qt.x

    The test program has simple mouse interaction:
        Left-Click and drag to rotate the view
    and keyboard:
        g - add particles
        h - add hose of particles
        j - add hose of particles for pipe scene
        p - print timings of various functions
        w, a, s, d - move around like FPS controls


    hit Q or ESC to exit (right now clicking the x on the window will not properly clean up GPU memory...)
